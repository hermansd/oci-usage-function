# Oracle Function for Importing Usage and Cost Data from OCI

This is a project for loading OCI usage data into database using Oracle Function Service.  It is bassed on [usage_to_adw](https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk/tree/master/examples/usage_reports_to_adw) python example.

**DISCLAIMER – This is not an official Oracle application, It does not supported by Oracle Support, It should NOT be used for utilization calculation purposes, and rather OCI's official [cost analysis](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm) and [usage reports](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/usagereportsoverview.htm) features should be used instead.**
